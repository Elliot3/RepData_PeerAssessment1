# Reproducible Research: Peer Assessment 1



## Loading and preprocessing the data

First I will set the correct working directory and then read the data into R 
using the Read CSV function.

setwd("~/Repository/Coursera/RepData_PeerAssessment1")
data <- read.csv("activity.csv", header=TRUE)
data2 <- data[complete.cases(data),]

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

I will use the Tapply function to get the mean number of steps per day.

stepsPerDay <- tapply(data$steps, data$date, mean)

## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
